		<hr width="3px">
		<p class="content" >The patent deals with accurately detecting particulates in the air. This would not only help in detecting potential poisonous gases, but also look out for the air quality, but also things like pollen that could cause allergic reactions.Apple’s proposal involves the use of three laser light sources and three total-internal-reflection lenses. This will then be coupled with light sensors or photodiodes. This system helps to overcome some of the problems with existing systems which might not be quite as accurate as wind could blow around particles in the air which could result in less-than-accurate readings.</p>

		<p class="content" >
			In a blog post this morning, Amazon unveiled two new car-focused features for its Alexa voice assistant. Auto Mode turns the Alexa smartphone app into a responsive, driver-friendly display, while Start My Commute provides on-demand weather, traffic updates, and a choice of entertainment. Auto Mode will be rolling out to iOS and Android customers in the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, India, Italy, Spain, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand in the coming weeks. Start My Commute will initially only be available in the U.S. when it launches in the same time frame.The new capabilities come as used car sales have skyrocketed during the pandemic. As the New York Times reports, buyers are snatching up used vehicles as second or third cars so they can avoid trains, buses, taxis, and other potentially high-risk infection vectors. Others are purchasing used rather than new to save cash in an uncertain economy. In June, franchised car dealers sold 1.2 million used cars and trucks, according to Edmunds — up 22% from a year earlier.
